This plugin allows users to sign in through an SSO provider (such as Google, Microsoft, or your own provider). This enables one-click signin.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17993169/149681516-f93b43f5-fa5c-4c1f-a909-e5414878a864.mp4

Existing users may link new SSO accounts, or remove existing links using self-service at `/SSOViews/linking`.

## Current State:

This is 100% alpha software! PRs are welcome to improve the code.

~~There is NO admin configuration! You must use the API to configure the program!~~ Added by [strazto](https://github.com/strazto) in PR [#18](https://github.com/9p4/jellyfin-plugin-sso/pull/18) and [#27](https://github.com/9p4/jellyfin-plugin-sso/pull/27).

**[This is for Jellyfin >=10.8](https://github.com/9p4/jellyfin-plugin-sso/issues/3) and only on the Web UI or clients supporting [Quick Connect](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/server/quick-connect)**

**This README reflects the branch it is currently on! Switch tags to view version-specific documentation!**

## Tested Providers

[Find provider specific documentation in providers.md](providers.md)

- Authelia
- authentik
- Keycloak
  - OIDC
- Pocket ID
- Kanidm
- Google OpenID: Works, but usernames are all numeric

## Supported Protocols

- [OpenID](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/)

> SAML support was removed to reduce the surface area of the plugin. This plugin now supports OpenID Connect only.

## Security

This is my first time writing C# so please take all of the code written here with a grain of salt. This program should be reasonably secure since it validates all information passed from the client with either a certificate or a secret internal state.

## Installing

### Stable (recommended)

Add the stable package repository to your Jellyfin plugin repositories (**Dashboard → Plugins → Repositories → +**):

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eddymoulton/jellyfin-plugin-oidc/manifest-stable/manifest.json
```

Then install **OIDC Authentication** from the plugin catalog!

See [Contributing](#contributing) for instructions on how to build from source.

### Unstable builds

If you're impatient/brave/feel like helping us test things out, you can opt into unstable builds, which are built automatically from every change on the `main` branch and versioned `N.YYMM.run.0`.

Add the unstable repository instead of (or alongside) the stable one:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eddymoulton/jellyfin-plugin-oidc/manifest-unstable/manifest.json
```

Unstable builds may have new features unavailable in stable, but **be warned**: things change frequently, may break, and you could lose data. They are not intended for production use.

### Branch builds

Builds for individual feature branches are uploaded as artifacts on each branch's GitHub Actions run (named `oidc-<branch>-<sha>.zip`) and must be installed manually. They are not published to any repository.

## Roadmap

- [x] Admin page
- [ ] Automated tests
- [x] Add role/claims support
- [x] Use canonical usernames instead of preferred usernames
- [x] Add user self-service
- [ ] Finalize RBAC access for all user properties

## Examples

### Creating A Login Button On The Main Page

In the Jellyfin administration UI, under "General", there is a "Branding" section. In that section, add the following code in the "Login disclaimer" block (replacing `PROVIDER_NAME` and the domain):

```html
<form action="https://jellyfin.example.com/sso/OID/start/PROVIDER_NAME">
  <button class="raised block emby-button button-submit">
    Sign in with SSO
  </button>
</form>
```

Then, add the following code in the "Custom CSS code" section:

```css
a.raised.emby-button {
  padding: 0.9em 1em;
  color: inherit !important;
}

.disclaimerContainer {
  display: block;
}
```

![screenshot of the configuration page with the same code](img/custom-button.png)

For more information, refer to [issue #16](https://github.com/9p4/jellyfin-plugin-sso/issues/16).

### OpenID

Example for adding an OpenID configuration with the API using [curl](https://curl.se/)

`curl -v -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"oidEndpoint": "https://keycloak.example.com/realms/test", "oidClientId": "jellyfin-oid", "oidSecret": "short secret here", "enabled": true, "enableAuthorization": true, "enableAllFolders": false, "enabledFolders": [], "adminRoles": ["jellyfin-admin"], "roles": ["allowed-to-use-jellyfin"], "enableFolderRoles": true, "folderRoleMapping": [{"role": "allowed-to-watch-movies", "folders": ["cc7df17e2f3509a4b5fc1d1ff0a6c4d0", "f137a2dd21bbc1b99aa5c0f6bf02a805"]}], "roleClaim": "realm_access", "oidScopes" : [""]}' "https://myjellyfin.example.com/sso/OID/Add/PROVIDER_NAME?api_key=API_KEY_HERE"`

The OpenID provider must have the following configuration (again, I am using Keycloak)

- Access Type: Confidential
- Standard Flow Enabled
- Redirect URI: [https://myjellyfin.example.com/sso/OID/redirect/PROVIDER_NAME](https://myjellyfin.example.com/sso/OID/redirect/PROVIDER_NAME)
- Base URL: [https://myjellyfin.example.com](https://myjellyfin.example.com)

Make sure that `clientid` is replaced with the actual client ID and `PROVIDER_NAME` is replaced with the chosen provider name!

## API Endpoints

The API is all done from a base URL of `/sso/`

### OpenID

#### Flow

- GET `OID/redirect/PROVIDER_NAME`: This is the OpenID callback path. This will return HTML and JavaScript for the client to login with a given provider name.
- GET `OID/start/PROVIDER_NAME`: This is the OpenID initiator: it will begin the authorization flow for OpenID with a given provider name.
- POST `OID/Auth/PROVIDER_NAME`: This is the OpenID client-side API: the HTML and JavaScript client will call this endpoint to receive Jellyfin credentials for a given provider name. Post format is in JSON with the following keys:
  - `deviceId`: string. Device ID.
  - `deviceName`: string. Device name.
  - `appName`: string. App name.
  - `appVersion`: string. App version.
  - `data`: string. The OpenID state. Used to verify a request.

#### Configuration

These all require authorization. Append an API key to the end of the request: `curl "http://myjellyfin.example.com/sso/OID/Get?api_key=9c6e5fae4ae145669e6b7a3942f813b7"`

- POST `OID/Add/PROVIDERNAME`: This adds or overwrites a configuration for OpenID with a given provider name. It accepts JSON with the following keys and format:
  - `oidEndpoint`: string. The OpenID endpoint. Must have a `.well-known` path available.
  - `oidClientId`: string. The OpenID client ID.
  - `oidSecret`: string. The OpenID secret.
  - `enabled`: boolean. Determines if the provider is enabled or not.
  - `enableAuthorization`: boolean: Determines if the plugin sets permissions for the user. If false, the user will start with no permissions and an administrator will add permissions. If disabled, then the permissions of users will not be modified and the Jellyfin defaults will be used instead.
  - `enableAllFolders`: boolean. Determines if the client logging in is allowed access to all folders.
  - `enabledFolders`: array of strings. If `enableAllFolders` is set to false, then this will be used to determine what folders the users who log in through this provider are allowed to use.
  - `roles`: array of strings. This validates the OpenID response against the claim set in `roleClaim`. If a user has any of these roles, then the user is authenticated. Leave blank to disable role checking. This currently only works for Keycloak (to my knowledge).
  - `adminRoles`: array of strings. This uses the OpenID response against the claim set in `roleClaim`. If a user has any of these roles, then the user is an admin. Leave blank to disable (default is to not enable admin permissions).
  - `enableFolderRoles`: boolean. Determines if role-based folder access should be used.
  - `folderRoleMapping`: object in the format "role": string and "folders": array of strings. The user with this role will have access to the following folders if `enableFolderRoles` is enabled. To get the IDs of the folders, GET the `/Library/MediaFolders` URL with an API key. Look for the `Id` attribute.
  - `enableLiveTvRoles`: boolean. Determines if role-based Live TV access should be used.
  - `liveTvRoles`: array of strings. If `enableLiveTvRoles` is enabled, then the user's roles will be checked against these. If the user is granted permission, then the user will be able to view Live TV.
  - `liveTvManagementRoles`: array of strings. If `enableLiveTvRoles` is enabled, then the user's roles will be checked against these. If the user is granted permission, then the user will be able to manage Live TV.
  - `enableLiveTv`: boolean. Whether to allow Live TV by default. This applies even if `enableLiveTvRoles` is enabled.
  - `enableLiveTvManagement`: boolean. Whether to allow Live TV management by default. This applies even if `enableLiveTvRoles` is enabled.
  - `roleClaim`: string. This is the value in the OpenID response to check for roles. For Keycloak, it is `realm_access.roles` by default. The first element is the claim type, the subsequent values are to parse the JSON of the claim value. Use a "\\." to denote a literal ".". This expects a list of strings from the OIDC server.
  - `oidScopes` : array of strings. Each contains an additional scope name to include in the OIDC request.
    - For some OIDC providers (For example, [authelia](https://github.com/9p4/jellyfin-plugin-sso/issues/23#issuecomment-1112237616)), additional scopes may be required in order to validate group membership in role claim.
    - Leave empty to only request the default scopes.
  - `defaultProvider`: string. The set provider then gets assigned to the user after they have logged in. If it is not set, nothing is changed. With this, a user can login with SSO but is still able to log in via other providers later. See the `Unregister` endpoint.
  - `defaultUsernameClaim`: string. The provider will use the claim to create the users' usernames. If not set, it fallbacks to `preferred_username`.
  - `avatarUrlFormat`: string. The URL format for the users avatars. OIDC claims can be used by using the `@{claim_type}` syntax. If not set, the avatars won't change.
  - `disableHttps`: boolean. Determines whether the OpenID discovery endpoint requires HTTPS.
  - `doNotValidateEndpoints`: boolean. Determines whether the OpenID discovery process will validate endpoints. This may be required for Google.
  - `doNotValidateIssuerName`: boolean. Determines whether the OpenID discovery process will validate the OpenID issuer name.
  - `schemeOverride`: string. Sets the scheme for URLs used. Can be useful if the plugin refuses to use HTTPS URLs.
- GET `OID/Del/PROVIDER_NAME`: This removes a configuration for OpenID for a given provider name.
- GET `OID/Get`: Lists the configurations currently available.
- GET `OID/States`: Lists currently active OpenID flows in progress.

### Misc

- POST `Unregister/username`: This "unregisters" a user from SSO. A JSON-formatted string must be posted with the new authentication provider. To reset to the default provider, use `Jellyfin.Server.Implementations.Users.DefaultAuthenticationProvider` like so: `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '"Jellyfin.Server.Implementations.Users.DefaultAuthenticationProvider"' "https://myjellyfin.example.com/sso/Unregister/username?api_key=API_KEY`

## Limitations

Logging in with an SSO account that has the same username as an existing Jellyfin account will override the permissions for the user. Use caution when overriding the administrator account!

~~There is no GUI to sign in. You have to make it yourself! The buttons should redirect to something like this: [https://myjellyfin.example.com/sso/OID/start/clientid](https://myjellyfin.example.com/sso/OID/start/clientid) replacing `clientid` with the provider client ID.~~

~~Furthermore, there is no functional admin page (yet). PRs for this are welcome. In the meantime, you have to interact with the API to add or remove configurations.~~ Added by [strazto](https://github.com/strazto) in PR [#18](https://github.com/9p4/jellyfin-plugin-sso/pull/18) and [#27](https://github.com/9p4/jellyfin-plugin-sso/pull/27).

There is also no logout callback. Logging out of Jellyfin will log you out of Jellyfin only, instead of the SSO provider as well.

~~This only supports Jellyfin on its own domain (for now). This is because I'm using string concatenation for generating some URLs. A PR is welcome to patch this.~~ Fixed in [PR #1](https://github.com/9p4/jellyfin-plugin-sso/pull/1).

**This only works on the web UI**. ~~The user must open the Jellyfin web UI BEFORE using the SSO program to populate some values in the localStorage.~~ Fixed by implementing a comment by [Pfuenzle](https://github.com/Pfuenzle) in [Issue #5](https://github.com/9p4/jellyfin-plugin-sso/issues/5#issuecomment-1041864820).

## Credits and Thanks

Much thanks to the [Jellyfin LDAP plugin](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-plugin-ldapauth) for offering a base for me to start on my plugin.

I use the [Duende IdentityModel OIDC Client](https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/foss) library for the OpenID side of things.

Thanks to these projects, without which I would have been pulling my hair out implementing these protocols from scratch.

## Something funny about the origins of this plugin

It totally slipped my mind, but I had [requested this functionality a few years back](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/issues/2012). What goes around comes around, I guess.
